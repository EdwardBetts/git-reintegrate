git-reintegrate(1)
==================

NAME
----
git-reintegrate - Manage integration branches in Git

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git reintegrate' --create <name> [<base>]
'git reintegrate' [<action>...] [<branch>]
'git reintegrate' (--continue | --abort)

DESCRIPTION
-----------
include::description.txt[]

OPTIONS
-------
--create::
	Create a new integration branch.  If `--edit` is also specified then
	the instruction sheet will be opened for editing.  If `--rebuild` is
	also specified then the branch will be built.
+
The name of the integration branch must be specified.  If a second positional
argument is specified then it is used as the base branch, otherwise ``master''
will be used.

--edit::
	Edit the instruction sheet for an integration branch.
+
If no branch name is specified then the current branch must be an existing
integration branch.

--rebuild::
--no-rebuild::
	Rebuild the integration branch.  The `--no-rebuild` form exists to
	suppress automatic rebuilding if the `integration.autorebuild`
	configuration variable is set.
+
If no branch name is specified then the current branch must be an existing
integration branch.

--cat::
	Print the instruction sheet for the integration branch.  If this is
	combined with options which modify the instruction sheet, then those
	operations will be performed before it is printed.

--status::
	Prints the status of the integration branch.

--add=<branch>::
	Appends a line `merge <branch>` to the instruction list, causing that
	branch to be included in the integration branch when it is next
	rebuilt.  This option may be specified multiple times to add multiple
	branches.

--continue::
	Restart the building process after having resolved a merge conflict.

--abort::
	Abort the rebuild operation and reset HEAD to the original branch.

--autocontinue::
--no-autocontinue::
	Continues automatically if the rerere mechanism manages to resolve all
	conflicts during a merge.

If `--continue` or `--abort` are specified then no other options may be given.
Otherwise at least one of `--create`, `--add`, `--edit`, `--cat` or
`--rebuild` must be specified.  If more than one is specified then they will
be performed in the order 'create', 'add', 'edit', 'cat', 'rebuild', 'status'.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

integration.autocontinue::
	Sets the default for the `--autocontinue` option.

integration.autorebuild::
	Automatically rebuild the integration branch after creating/editing it
	if `--no-rebuild` is not specified.

FORMAT OF INSTRUCTIONS
----------------------
The instruction sheet consists of a series of instructions which begin in
column zero, each of which may be followed by indented comments.  The
following instructions are supported:

+base+ '<ref>'::
	Resets the state of the integration branch to the specified revision.
	This should always be the first instruction in the instruction sheet,
	and should appear only at the top of the instruction sheet.

+merge+ '<ref>' '[<options>]'::
	Merges the specified ref into the integration branch.  Any comments
	following the instruction are appended to the merge commit's commit
	message.
+
If any options are given after the ref (and on the same line) then these are
passed to 'git merge'.  This may be useful for specifying an alternative merge
strategy for a branch.

+.+ '<args...>'::
	Ignores this command and its description.  This can be used to remove
	a branch from the integration branch without needing to delete it and
	its description from the instruction sheet.
+
For example, if you need to remove a branch until it is in better shape but
don't want to lose track of it, you can simply add ``. '' to the beginning of
that branch's 'merge' line.

Example
~~~~~~~
------
base master

merge my-experimental-feature

  I think this is a good idea, but want to dogfood it before I
  decide whether to submit it upstream.

merge my-site-specific-changes

  Some changes to suit my environment.  DO NOT SUBMIT THESE.
